	<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:&nbsp; In this talk, we discuss the problem of Byzantines in the context of Distributed Inference Networks. 
	Distributed inference networks have many applications including military surveillance, cognitive radio networks and smart grid. 
	A distributed inference network typically consists of local sensors sending information to a central processing unit 
	(known as the Fusion Center) that is responsible for inference. The network may contain malicious sensors that may engage 
	in data falsification which can result in a wrong inference at the Fusion Center. Drawing parallel to the "Byzantine Generals Problem", 
	the local sensors are the generals who try to make a decision in the presence of traitors called "Byzantines". 
	We present an overview of recent research on this problem. Discussion includes the susceptibility of distributed 
	inference networks to Byzantines, and then the possible protection of these networks through mitigation of Byzantines. 
	This problem setup lends itself to a game theoretic formulation. 
	The game between the network and Byzantines is discussed and solutions presented. 
	Some avenues for further research in this area are provided. </p>

	<p><strong>Bio</strong>: 
	Pramod K. Varshney was born in Allahabad, India, in 1952. He received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and computer science (with highest honors), 
	and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1972, 1974, and 1976 respectively. 
	Since 1976 he has been with Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY where he is currently a Distinguished Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer 
	Science and the Director of CASE: Center for Advanced Systems and Engineering. He is also an Adjunct Professor of Radiology at Upstate 
	Medical University in Syracuse, NY. His current research interests are in distributed sensor networks and data fusion, 
	detection and estimation theory, human-machine systems, wireless communications, physical layer security, image processing, and radar. </p>
	
<p>While at the University of Illinois, Dr. Varshney was a James Scholar, a Bronze Tablet Senior, and a Fellow. 
He is a member of Tau Beta Pi and is the recipient of the 1981 ASEE Dow Outstanding Young Faculty Award. 
He was elected to the grade of Fellow of the IEEE in 1997 for his contributions in the area of distributed detection and data fusion. 
In 2000, he received the Third Millennium Medal from the IEEE and Chancellorâ€™s Citation for exceptional academic achievement at Syracuse University. 
He is the recipient of the IEEE 2012 Judith A. Resnik Award. He received an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree 
from Drexel University in 2014, ECE Distinguished Alumni Award from UIUC in 2015, and the Yaakov Bar-Shalom 
Award for Lifetime Excellence in Information Fusion, ISIF in 2018. He was the President of International Society of Information Fusion during 2001.

	<p><strong>Choh-Ming Li Professor of Information Engineering,<em> The Chinese University of Hong Kong.</em></strong></p>

	<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:&nbsp; Protocol sequences and their generalization, schedule sequences, are ideal for addressing
distributed communication systems that involve delay-constrained traffic. In this talk, we will
present a survey of recent results on protocol sequences and schedule sequences. We will also
explain how they can be applied to ad hoc networks and integrated networked control systems. </p>

	<p><strong>Bio</strong>: 
	 Wing Shing Wong graduated from the Yale University with a combined MS and BA
degree and obtained a PhD degree from the Harvard University. He is a Fellow of the
Hong Kong Institution of Engineers (FHKIE), a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and the Vice President of the Hong Kong Academy of
Engineering Sciences (HKAES). </p>

<p> He joined the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 1992 after working ten years at
AT&T Bell Laboratories. He is now serving as a Choh-Ming Li Research Professor
of Information Engineering and the Master of S.H. Ho College. He served as the
Chairman of the Information Engineering Department from 1995 to 2003 and the Dean
of the Graduate School of CUHK from 2005 to 2014. He was the Science Advisor in
the Innovation and Technology Commission in the Hong Kong SAR Government from
2003 to 2005. He served from 2006 to 2008 as a Board Director and Chairman of the
Technical Committee of the Hong Kong Applied Science and Technology Research
Institute Company Limited (ASTRI) and is currently a Board Director of The Nano and
Advanced Materials Institute Limited (NAMI).</p>
